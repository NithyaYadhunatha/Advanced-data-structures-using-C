# 📌 Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains C programs for fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. The programs cover **arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and sorting techniques**, implemented using C.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### **PART-A**
1. **Array Operations**: Menu-driven program for array manipulation (creation, insertion, deletion, display).
2. **Bank Customer Records**: Structure-based program to manage customer account details and balance updates.
3. **Stack Operations**: Array-based stack implementation with push, pop, palindrome check, overflow/underflow handling.
4. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Converts expressions using stack-based algorithm.
5. **Postfix Expression Evaluation**: Evaluates postfix expressions with single-digit operands.
6. **Tower of Hanoi**: Recursive approach to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.

### **PART-B**
7. **Circular Queue**: Array-based circular queue implementation supporting insertion, deletion, and overflow/underflow handling.
8. **Singly Linked List (SLL)**: Operations on student data, including insertion and deletion at the front and end.
9. **Doubly Linked List (DLL)**: Employee data management with insertion, deletion, and double-ended queue demonstration.
10. **Polynomial Addition**: Uses circular linked lists to store and add two polynomials.
11. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: BST implementation with insertion, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), and search.
12. **Binary Search Algorithm**: Demonstrates binary search on a sorted array.
